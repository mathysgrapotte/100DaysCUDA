# Choosing CUDA Block Sizes for Matrix Operations

## Matrix Multiplication Considerations
For matrices of size M×N and N×P producing M×P output:

### 1. Basic Constraints
- Maximum threads per block: 1024
- Must be multiple of warp size (32)
- Consider register usage per thread
- Consider shared memory per block

### 2. Block Size Selection Process

1. **Start with Hardware Limits**

```cpp
// Example calculation
int maxThreadsPerBlock = 1024; // Hardware max
int warpsPerBlock = maxThreadsPerBlock / 32; // 32 threads per warp
// 1024/32 = 32 warps maximum
```

2. **Consider Matrix Dimensions**

```cuda
// For matrices of size M×N and N×P:
dim3 block(BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE); // Square blocks are common
// Choose BLOCK_SIZE so that:
// - M/BLOCK_SIZE has minimal remainder
// - N/BLOCK_SIZE has minimal remainder
// - P/BLOCK_SIZE has minimal remainder
```

3. **Common Block Sizes by Matrix Size**

```
Matrix Size | Recommended Block Size | Reasoning
--------------|----------------------|------------
1024 x 1024 | 16x16 (256 threads) | Divides evenly, good occupancy
2048 x 2048 | 32x16 (512 threads) | Better for larger matrices
512 x 512 | 16x16 (256 threads) | Good balance for smaller matrices
Arbitrary | 16x16 or 32x8 | Safe default choices
```

### 3. Performance Optimization Rules

1. **For Regular Sized Matrices (powers of 2)**

```cpp
// Choose block size that divides matrix dimensions evenly
dim3 block(16, 16); // 256 threads, good default
// or
dim3 block(32, 8); // 256 threads, alternative layout
```

2. **For Irregular Sized Matrices**

```cpp
// Choose smaller block size to avoid thread wastage
dim3 block(8, 8); // 64 threads, more flexible
// Calculate grid size with ceiling division
dim3 grid(
(N + block.x - 1) / block.x,
(M + block.y - 1) / block.y
);
```

3. **Memory Access Optimization**

```cpp
// For coalesced memory access:
// Choose block.x to be multiple of 32 (warp size)
// Example:
dim3 block(32, 8); // 32 threads in x-direction
```

### 4. Quick Selection Guide

1. **Default Choice**
   - 16x16 = 256 threads
   - Good balance for most cases
   - Works well with common matrix sizes

2. **Large Matrices (>2048)**
   - 32x16 = 512 threads
   - Better throughput because:
     - More threads per block (512) means more parallel work
     - 32-wide in x-direction aligns perfectly with warp size
     - 16-high allows 2 warps vertically for better occupancy
   - Higher register usage because:
     - More threads per block need more registers
     - Each thread caches more data for larger matrices
     - Register pressure increases with thread count

3. **Small Matrices (<512)**
   - 8x8 = 64 threads
   - Reduces thread wastage
   - Better for irregular sizes

4. **Memory-Bound Operations**
   - 32x8 = 256 threads
   - Optimizes for coalesced access because:
     - 32 threads in x-direction matches warp size
     - Adjacent threads access adjacent memory locations
     - All threads in a warp can fetch/store data in a single transaction
   - Good warp utilization because:
     - Each block has exactly 8 warps (256/32)
     - Warps can be scheduled efficiently
     - No partial warps wasted
